# Mongolian Vocab

**Mongolian Vocab** is a simple, offline-first iOS app for learning and practicing Mongolian–English vocabulary.

The app is intentionally minimal: no accounts, no tracking, no ads. All vocabulary and learning progress are stored locally on the device.

## Tech Stack

- **Expo (Managed Workflow)**
- **React Native**
- **TypeScript**
- **expo-sqlite** for local persistence on native platforms
- **AsyncStorage** fallback on web
- **EAS Build + TestFlight** for iOS distribution
- **GitHub Actions** for CI builds and OTA publishing

## Storage & Data

This app is fully offline. All data lives on-device.

- **Native (iOS/Android):** SQLite via `expo-sqlite`
- **Web:** AsyncStorage
- **Migration:** On first native launch, AsyncStorage data is migrated into SQLite automatically

### Dictionary Sources

- **Base dictionary:** embedded in the app bundle
- **Packs:** versioned vocabulary packs that can be added from the Dictionary Updates screen
- **Custom words:** created by the user

## Dictionary Packs & OTA Updates

- Packs are versioned and can be previewed, added, dismissed, or upgraded.
- OTA updates (via `expo-updates`) deliver new pack data when enabled.
- The “Auto-download New Packs” toggle controls OTA update checks.

## Dictionary Size

The base dictionary contains ~900 words, and grows when you add packs or custom entries.

## Backend

There is no backend API for the vocabulary app. The server in this repo is used only for static web builds and Expo manifest routing.
